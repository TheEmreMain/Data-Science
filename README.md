Exercise 2 - Notebook Title
This is a Jupyterlite notebook for the Data Science Assignment.

Exercise 3 - Introduction
Welcome to this Data Science Assignment! In this notebook, we will explore various aspects of data science, including programming languages, libraries, and tools commonly used in the field. We will also cover some basic arithmetic operations and conversions. Let's get started!

Exercise 4 - Data Science Languages
Here are some popular programming languages used in data science:

Python
R
Julia
SAS
SQL
These languages provide powerful capabilities for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

Exercise 5 - Data Science Libraries
Data science libraries are essential for working with data and performing various tasks. Some commonly used libraries include:

NumPy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.
Pandas: Offers data manipulation and analysis tools, including data structures like DataFrames for efficient data handling.
Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, and more.
TensorFlow: An open-source deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
PyTorch: Another popular deep learning library that provides dynamic computation graphs and a flexible framework for model development.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API that simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models.
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, providing an enhanced aesthetic appeal.
These libraries, among others, form the foundation of data science workflows and enable efficient data analysis and modeling.

Exercise 6 - Data Science Tools
Here is a table showcasing various tools commonly used in data science:

Tool	Description
Jupyter	An open-source web-based interactive computing environment
Anaconda	A Python distribution that includes popular data science packages
Tableau	A data visualization and business intelligence tool
D3.js	A JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations
Apache Spark	A fast and general-purpose cluster computing system
Hadoop	A framework for distributed storage and processing of big data
Power BI	A business analytics tool provided by Microsoft
SAS	A software suite used for advanced analytics and business intelligence
These tools offer a wide range of functionalities and play a crucial role in the data science ecosystem.

Exercise 7 - Arithmetic Expressions
In data science, arithmetic expressions are commonly used for calculations and data transformations. They involve various mathematical operators, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (**).

Let's explore some examples of arithmetic expressions in the following code cells.

Exercise 8 - Multiplication and Addition
Let's start with a simple arithmetic expression that involves multiplication and addition:

python
Copy code
a = 5
b = 2

result = a * b + 10
print(result)
The result will be calculated by multiplying a and b, then adding 10 to the product.

Exercise 9 - Minutes to Hours Conversion
Sometimes, we need to convert units of time for easier analysis or presentation. Let's write a code cell to convert minutes to hours:

python
Copy code
minutes = 120

hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
In this example, we divide the minutes variable by 60 to obtain the equivalent value in hours.

Exercise 10 - Objectives
The objectives of this assignment are as follows:

Understand the key programming languages used in data science.
